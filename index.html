            <img src="images/food_image_home.jpg" alt="lebanese food picture">
            <p>Lebanese cuisine is a vibrant fusion of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern flavors, known for its fresh ingredients, aromatic spices, and mezze-style dining. Meals often start with an array of small dishes like creamy hummus, smoky baba ganoush, tabbouleh, and fattoush, inviting everyone to share and savor together. Iconic dishes such as kibbeh, shawarma, and stuffed grape leaves bring heartiness, while fresh herbs, garlic, lemon, and olive oil infuse dishes with bright, savory notes. Desserts like baklava and maamoul, filled with nuts and sweet syrup, offer a delightful finish, often paired with rich Arabic coffee or tea. Lebanese food goes beyond taste—it's a warm, social experience, bringing people together around a shared table in the spirit of hospitality.</p>
